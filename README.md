## Project 3: JS Documentation Website

Welcome to my third GitHub project! ðŸš€

Iâ€™ve created a JavaScript Documentation website by following a tutorial from the "Do Some Coding" YouTube channel. The website mimics a real documentation site, where you can click on different sections and view the details for each.

## Project Overview

- **Tools Used**: HTML5
- **Features**: 
   - Interactive navigation through different sections of the documentation
   - Clean and simple UI
- **Goal**: Practice and improve my skills in HTML5 and structuring web content.

## What I Learned

Working on this project helped me improve:
- My understanding of **HTML5** for building well-structured web pages
- **Organizing content** to create a documentation-style layout
